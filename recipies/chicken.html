    <p>Make this really speedy meal when time is of the essence. It's ideal for using up left-over rice or chicken, too</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>2 chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>500g cooked basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>150g frozen peas</li>
        <li>chilli sauce, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok over a medium-high heat. Season the chicken well and fry for 4-5 minutes or until golden. Scoop out onto a plate using a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, then tip in the garlic and ginger, and cook for another few minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, tossing until fully reheated. Push everything to the side of the pan and pour in the eggs. Leave for a minute to set slightly, then break up into large pieces and toss with the rice. Season with the soy sauce, then add the peas and return the cooked chicken to the pan, tossing everything together for a few minutes until the peas have heated through. Serve drizzled with chilli sauce.</li>
